Features
--------

- **MCNP Weight Window Handling:** Efficiently read and modify MCNP Weight Window (WWINP) files to optimize computational performance, prevent oversplitting, and avoid irregular batch or endless simulations.


- **High-Performance Processing:** 
    - Read large WWINP files (>1GB) in seconds
    - Write large weight window files (~1GB) in approximately 5 minutes (hardware dependent)


- **Advanced Querying:** Access specific weight window values filtered by:
    - Particle type
    - Time bin
    - Energy bin
    - Position coordinates


- **Weight Window Optimization:** Modify weight window values to enhance simulation efficiency


- **Data Visualization:** (Coming Soon)
    - 3D visualization using PyVista
    - Heat maps
    - Cross-sectional views


- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive API for weight window manipulation
