Upgrading to the Latest Version
-------------------------------

If you already have WWINPy installed and want to upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. **Clear the pip cache (recommended for ensuring a clean installation):**

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip cache purge

2. **Upgrade to the latest version of WWINPy:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install --upgrade wwinpy

3. **Verify the installed version:**

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip show wwinpy

   This command will display the package information, including the currently installed version. Ensure it matches the latest version available on PyPI.
